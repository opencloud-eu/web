# Usage

## Components

If the design-system is initialized properly, there is no need to import components. For example, to use the `OcButton` component:

```
<oc-button>
  Click me!
</oc-button>
```

## Utility classes

The design-system does not provide any utility classes. Instead, it uses Tailwind, which is provided by the parent application. Please refer to the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for more information.

## Helper methods

The design-system provides a set of helper methods and composables that might be helpful, especially when developing apps or extensions within the OpenCloud ecosystem.
