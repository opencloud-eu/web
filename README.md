OpenCloud Web is a single page, standalone frontend, based on modern web technologies. It brings new features as well as improved user flows and can be deployed independent of the backend server.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with OpenCloud Web:

- üóÇ **Files**: Upload, download, search and manage files (as you may know it for example from Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive etc.).
- üë• **Share:** Allow fine-grained access to files and whole folders directly with other users on your OpenCloud.
- üîó **Links**: Create links and share them with anyone in the world - optional password-protection available.
- üìù **Write**: Edit your documents with the editor of your choice like Collabora, ONLYOFFICE or Microsoft Word and more.
- ü§ù **Collaborate** in real-time on documents.
- üöÄ **Spaces**: You have to manage important projects? Let Spaces, the new special folders, keep order.
- ‚óÄÔ∏è **Versioning** Saved the wrong version? We have the time machine you were looking for! Easily go back in time and restore older versions of your files.
- üì• **Drop-folders:** Collect files from other people in one folder via a simple link, ex. homework from pupils or photos from your family - optional password-protection available.
- üîí **Privacy first:** OpenCloud Web is GDPR compliant and can both be used completely internally or together with external people. It also will never "phone home".
- üõ° **Secure:** OpenCloud Web is an open source project which means that you can track every action, update and dependency of the software.
- ‚ôø **Inclusive:** Our goal is to be accessible for kids as well as seniors and for newbies as well as experts - since we are all affected by physical and cognitive limitations, depending on our personal situation.
- üß© **Extensible:** OpenCloud Web is built as a platform that can be extended in the most developer friendly way.
- üåó **Darkmode:** Initialized with your browser settings, and easily switched to please your eyes better.
- üé≠ **Themes**: Customize to your branding needs or personal taste in no time.
- üëâ and many more...

While the `web` frontend provides a performant, elegant, accessible and themeable base, it also aims to be extendable with custom extensions provided by external developers.

## Repository structure

The backbone of this project is built by the following parts of the `packages`:

- **client:** Generated TypeScript client for communications with the OpenCloud APIs
- **container:** Static assets and rarely changing base files
- **extension-sdk:** Provides utilities for developing and integrating custom extensions
- **pkg:** Shared logic for various places inside the codebase
- **runtime:** Central place of (user) authentication, provisioning of the user interface layout, client side storage, routing, theming, dependencies and (sub)application handling

The repository's `packages` also contains the following apps, which can be en-/disabled via the `config.json`:

- **activities:** An extension that provides a detailed activity stream, showing recent updates
- **admin-settings:** An extension that allows administrators to manage users, groups, spaces and generic settings for their OpenCloud efficiently
- **app-store:** An extension that allows users to browse and download additional apps and extensions directly from the web interface
- **epub-reader:** An extension for opening ebook files
- **external:** An extension for creating, opening and editing files using the WOPI server
- **files:** The default extension and core part of the project, responsible for file sync-and-share - up- and downloading, sharing with other users/groups or via links, version management and more
- **ocm:** Open Cloud Mesh integration to allow for collaboration across OpenCloud instances
- **pdf-viewer:** An extension for opening PDF files without leaving the UI
- **preview:** An extension for opening audio, video and image files
- **search:** An extension for registering search providers, which then get rendered into the layout in the **runtime** using a portal
- **text-editor:** An extension for creating, opening and editing plain text files, like e.g. `.md` or `.txt`
- **webfinger:** Redirect app for the OpenCloud webfinger service
